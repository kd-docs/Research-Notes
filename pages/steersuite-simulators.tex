\chapter{SteerSuite program and exetuce}

In order to complete the following section, you need to install docker~\cite{docker} and apptainer~\cite{apptainer} in a 
place you have root privilege. Also, you need to clone SteerSuite~\cite{kdresearch-steersuite} in your machine as well.

\section{Compile portable SteerSuite Application using apptainer}

\label{sec:steersuite-compile}
To compile SteerSuite program without CogAI scenarios, comment out \verb"WITH_COGAI" marco from build/premake.lua.ÓÅÜ

\begin{minted}{diff}

\end{minted}

Then sif file can be generated by \mintinline{bash}{Makefile} under steersuite root directory with
\mint{bash}{make steersuite.sif}.
You will need to input sudo password while apptianer writing out the sif file.

Also the compilation of steersuite program can be done in same time, using following command
\mint{bash}{make singularity-compile}

\section{Compile SteerSuite with CogAI enabled}

You will also need CogAI~\cite{kdresearch-cogai} cloned into your local system. CogAI lib is linked to SteerSuite in 
runtime so no need to compile CogAI unless you are using them in scenarios. CogAI headers, though, are required to build 
a steersuite binary with CogAI enabled. CogAI should be installed to steersuite with

\begin{minted}{bash}
ln -s "/path/to/CogAI/root" "/${STEERSUITE_ROOT}/build/cog-ai" 
\end{minted}

Then, follow the compilation instructions described in \ref{sec:steersuite-compile}.
